[![dependency status](https://deps.rs/repo/github/replicadse/agree/status.svg)](https://deps.rs/repo/github/replicadse/agree)\
`agree` is a CLI tool for easily applying multi-key-turn security via `Shamirs Secret Sharing`.

## Project state

`agree` is **unstable**.

## Example

### Split a secret into _n_ shares

To split a secret (file) into shares, execute one of the following examples.:

* Data is in a file (`Cargo.toml`): \
  `agree split -s Cargo.toml`
* Data is generated by an inline shell script and written to `STDOUT` (this approach uses process substitution): \
  `agree split -s <(printf "secret")`

This command is interactive and asks the user to provide data like share name, file path and optional password to encrypt the payload.

### Restore a secret from _n_ shares

In the following example, the secret was split into 2 shares. We need to provide exactly two shares in order to restore the secret and write it to `STDOUT`.\
This command is interactive as it might prompt for the password of the share if it's payload is encrypted.

```
agree restore -s ./share1.file -s ./share2.file
```
